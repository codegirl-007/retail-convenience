# Retail Convenience App - Changelog

## [2024-06-26] - Apple Pay Integration & Major Refactoring

### ✅ **Completed**

#### **Code Organization & Documentation**
- **Complete codebase reorganization** for developer maintainability
- **Created separate model files**:
  - `Models.swift`: ProductCategory, Product, CartItem structs
  - `CartManager.swift`: Cart business logic with comprehensive documentation
  - `ProductData.swift`: Static product data provider  
  - `PaymentManager.swift`: UserDefaults payment storage management
- **Added comprehensive MARK comments** throughout all views for Xcode navigation
- **Documented all major components** with inline comments and section organization

#### **UI/UX Improvements**
- **Dashboard redesign**: Categories with horizontally scrollable products instead of navigation screens
- **Product card refinements**: 
  - Uniform sizing (160x200 pixels)
  - Smaller product icons (60x60 pixels)
  - Removed descriptions and stock count display
  - Green add-to-cart buttons, gray "Sold Out" for out-of-stock items
- **"Going fast!" corner banner** for items with <5 stock (orange diagonal ribbon)
- **Cart UI improvements**:
  - Better layout with quantity controls under product info
  - Price format as "/ea" ($1.99/ea)
  - Smaller, closer quantity control buttons

#### **Cart & Payment System**
- **Complete cart implementation** with CartManager class
- **Full-width "View Cart" button** showing item count when cart has items
- **Comprehensive CartView** with:
  - Empty cart state with friendly messaging
  - Quantity controls (+/- buttons)
  - Order summary with 8% tax calculation
  - Payment form with customer info and card details
  - Save payment info toggle using UserDefaults
  - Payment success flow that clears cart

#### **Apple Pay Integration**
- **Payment method selection** between Apple Pay and Credit Card (vertically stacked)
- **Full Apple Pay implementation** with PassKit integration:
  - PKPaymentRequest setup with merchant configuration
  - Payment summary items showing individual cart items and tax
  - ApplePayHandler delegate for authorization callbacks
  - Professional Apple Pay button styling (black background)
- **Enhanced payment UX**:
  - Payment method selector with smooth animations
  - Apple Pay benefits display (Touch ID/Face ID security)
  - Loading states with progress indicators
  - Fallback to credit card if Apple Pay unavailable

#### **Security Analysis & Planning**
- **Created comprehensive TODO.md** identifying critical security issues
- **Prioritized security tasks** as URGENT, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Stripe integration analysis** showing ~75% security risk reduction
- **5-phase implementation roadmap** for production readiness
- **Cleaned up TODO.md** to remove non-actionable "SOLVED BY STRIPE" items
- **Created comprehensive NOTES.md** with technical architecture documentation

### 🔄 **Follow-Up Items**

#### **Immediate Next Steps (This Sprint)**
1. **Go Server Setup** (NEW URGENT)
   - Set up Go server with proper project structure and routing
   - Implement secure API authentication (JWT tokens)
   - Create database schema for users, products, orders

2. **Apple Pay Production Setup** (HIGH)
   - Register Apple Pay Merchant ID with Apple
   - Add Apple Pay entitlements to iOS app
   - Configure server-side Apple Pay token processing

3. **Authentication Security** (URGENT)
   - Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2)
   - Add secure session management with JWT tokens
   - Replace hardcoded credentials with secure user database

#### **Next Sprint Priorities**
1. **Stripe Integration** (HIGH)
   - Integrate Stripe SDK and Stripe Elements
   - Implement webhook handling for payment confirmations
   - Add proper error handling for payment failures

2. **Data Security** (MEDIUM)
   - Implement SSL certificate pinning
   - Add secure logging practices (remove sensitive data)
   - Add input validation and sanitization

#### **Future Iterations**
- **Performance optimization**: Product image caching and lazy loading
- **Enhanced UX**: Search functionality, product filtering, favorites
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and conversion metrics
- **Monitoring**: Crash reporting and performance monitoring setup

### 📝 **Technical Notes**
- **Architecture**: Using SwiftUI with ObservableObject pattern for state management
- **State Management**: Authentication flow managed through @EnvironmentObject
- **Data Layer**: Mock data with plans for server API integration
- **Payment Flow**: Apple Pay integrated with PassKit, manual payments simulated
- **Apple Pay**: Full PKPaymentRequest implementation ready for server integration
- **Payment Methods**: Elegant selector with vertically stacked options

### 🚨 **Known Issues**
- Authentication uses hardcoded credentials (admin/password) - **SECURITY RISK**
- Payment data stored in UserDefaults without encryption - **SECURITY RISK**
- Apple Pay currently simulated (needs real merchant ID and server integration)
- No proper error handling for network failures
- No offline mode or data persistence beyond UserDefaults
